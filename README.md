# cave
A procedurally generated grid base 2d cave system, made with a custom c# Windows Forms engine. Contains a gravity-subjected arrow controllable player character, passive entities that fly or hop around, different biomes (perlin noise based), a perlin noise based cave system, all of which depend on a seed (except entity locations for now). Player can dig with X key and changes to the terrain and entities' positions are saved in .txts.
